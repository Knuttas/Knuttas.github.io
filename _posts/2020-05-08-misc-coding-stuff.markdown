Here is a website where you can tackle coding challenges called "Katas"
and hone your skills. Lots of fun.


[Codepen.io profile][projectlink]

Some projects I made when taking the freeCodeCamp full stack web developer
course.


[Glitch profile][projectlink3]

Even more stuff from the freeCodeCamp curriculum mostly learning how to
use the Node.js runtime environment.


[freeCodeCamp certification][projectlink4]

Finally, my certificate for completing the Full Stack developer certification.
This introduced me to the world of software development in a nice way.
